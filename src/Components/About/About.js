            <h1>Name : F. M. Fahmid Hossain</h1>
            <p>My Goal is to work for FAANG like companies as Software Engineer. In Order to achieve this, I am currently working on Problem solving on Leetcode. Since without any external pressure its difficult to stay focused to one goal, I keep myself focused to my goal by time boxing at least 6 hours a day for solving problems . This boxed time is uncompromising for me. Besides, I learn different web technologies and also love to work on React JS, CSS3, Boostrap, Tailwind . </p>
